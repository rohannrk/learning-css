# CSS Learning Projects

This repository contains my CSS learning journey with different projects organized across multiple branches.

## Repository Structure

This repository uses a unique branch structure where each learning project has its own branch, while the main branch contains all projects for easy overview.

### Branches

- **`master`** - Contains all projects for overview and easy access
- **`basics-of-css`** - CSS fundamentals and basic styling techniques
- **`basics-of-tailwind`** - Learning Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **`basics-cobalt-hero`** - Hero section design with Cobalt theme
- **`practice-keyboard`** - Interactive keyboard component practice
- **`responsive-design`** - Responsive design techniques and dark mode

### How to Use

1. **View all projects**: Stay on the `master` branch to see all projects
2. **Work on specific project**: Switch to the respective branch
   ```bash
   git checkout basics-of-css
   git checkout basics-of-tailwind
   # etc.
   ```
3. **Add new projects**: Create a new branch for each new learning project

### Project Details

Each project is a complete Next.js application with its own:
- Package.json with dependencies
- Source code in `/src` directory
- Public assets in `/public` directory
- Component structure

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Choose a branch to work on
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
